<br><p class = "me">I learnt Html(basics though) in my 10th.I sometimes wonder how google links so many websities together.
 This got me into web development.I took a couple of courses on html,css on code academy. It really helped.I learnt basics of Javascript too.
 Creating websities is really interesting to me.<br>I hope this interest helps me get inducted into the club and eventually develop my interest.
